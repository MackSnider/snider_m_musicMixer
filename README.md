#Music Mixer Assignment - Checkpoint 1 (snider_m_musicMixer)

This project was made for my Multimedia Authoring 2 class at Fanshawe College. Submission is for the Interactive Media Design program. Made by Mackenzie Snider.

## Assignment Description - for 1st Checkpoint

The checkpoint is a way to report to your Studio Managers (your teaching team - which is just me for now) your current progress / how you intend to continue to implement your strategy for your assignments.

## Motivation

My main motivation for building this assignment was sparked when I heard it was for marks. I also like building things, so this project has been pretty cool to plan out.

## Usage

Once this project is complete, you can use it to make cool beats. You could also use it to make a few cool songs. I guess the possibilities are endless.
